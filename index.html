        <p class="w3-large">
          According to respondents in 2022, even though dogs were the most desired pet species among Japanese people,
          cats are closing in on the popularity of canines.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-large">
          From this data, some questions can be asked regarding the ownership of pet cats and dogs:
        </p>
        <p class=" w3-large">
          1. What are the pet cat and dog ownership trends in the past few years?
        </p>
        <p class=" w3-large">
          2. What are the main reasons why people decide to keep cats and dogs as pets?
        </p>
        <p class=" w3-large">
          3. Did the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 affect cat and dog ownership trends?

            <p class="w3-opacity">What's up with pet cats and dogs over the past years? </p>
            <p>From the bar charts, we can see that the population of pet cats have increased on average over time,
              while the population of pet dogs have decreased. The decrease in pet dog population is such that the total
              population of pet cats is higher than total population of pet dogs.</p>

            <p class="w3-opacity">What about pet ownership?</p>
            <p>From the line charts, we can see that the number of pet dog owners has decreased over time, while the
              number of pet cat owners has roughly managed to maintain over time. However, as a whole, the number of pet
              dog owners is still higher than the number of pet cat owners across all years.</p>

            <p>Comparing between the 2 graphs, pet cat population increased on average, while ownership maintained. This
              may be an indicator that pet cat owners may own more than 1 pet cat.</p>

              getting pet dogs. However, it is important to note that while pet dog population is lower than pet cat
              population, the number of pet dog owners are higher than pet cat owners. This is further indication that
              pet cat owners may own more than 1 pet cat, while also being indicative that pet dog owners only own 1
              dog.</p>

        <h2>Recent Global Events and Pets</h2>
        <p>It is important to note that global and local events may have affected the acquisation of pets in Japan,
          causing the trends that we saw above.</p>
        <p>For instance, the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 caused a reduction in human interaction in Japan. According to
          news reports, pet ownership increased during Covid-19 due to an increase in the need for companionship. This
          can be noted from the increase in pet cat population, as well as pet cat ownership, from 2020 to 2021.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the Russia-Ukraine war that broke out in early 2022 has caused pet food prices to
          increase, which may be a factor in causing pet populations to decrease in 2022 as pets are less affordable.

              <p>Cats and Dogs are the most popular pets in Japan, surpassing other types of pets by large percentages.
                However, it is still important to note that majority (72.8%) of Japanese do not own pets.</p>

              <h3 class="w3-center">Population and Ownership</h3>
              <p class="w3-opacity w3-center">The relationship</p>
              <p>While pet cat population is higher than pet dog population, the ownership of pet dogs is higher than
                that of pet cats, indicating that pet cat owners typically own more than 1 cat.</p>

              <p class="w3-opacity w3-center">Linking to population and ownership</p>
              <p>The top reason for keeping pet cats is by adopting strays, making up 30.5% of reasons. This is followed
                by because the previous pet passed away, and because a friend asked the owner to take care of the cat.
                This shows that adopting stray cats is a popular way of getting a pet cat, and may explain the high
                amount of pet cats despite lower number of pet owners. We also observe sentimental value of having a pet
                being a factor, with owners replacing pet cats that passed away.</p>

              <p class="w3-opacity w3-center">Constrasting with that for cats</p>
              <p>The top reason for keeping dogs is because the previous pet passed away (at 26%), followed by seeing it
                in a pet shop and desiring it. This shows that the main reason owners get pet dogs is for sentimental
                value, to replace their previous pets. Other than that, owners also get pet dogs because of the
                popularity of dogs as pets, hence getting them from pet stores.</p>
